abstract: In this paper, the problem of detecting accidents using speed sensors distributed
  spatially on a freeway is considered. Due to the significant impact of road accidents
  on health and development, early and accurate detection of accidents is crucial.
  To address this issue, a novel Bayesian quickest change detection formulation is
  introduced, which considers both average detection delay and false alarm rate. The
  optimum strategy is derived via dynamic programming and shown to compare a recursively
  computed statistic with a function of false alarm to identify accidents as they
  happen. Considering that post-accident conditions are typically not known, two methods
  are proposed that recursively estimate multiple unknown parameters during the accident
  detection process. Further, four aggregation methods are proposed to improve performance
  exploiting spatial correlations between sensors. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate
  improvement up to 65.2% and 87.2% in average detection delay and false alarm rate,
  respectively, against prior work.
