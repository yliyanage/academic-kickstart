abstract: Herein, the problem of multi-class classification of participatory civil
  issue reports in crowdsourcing platforms is addressed. Specifically, an efficient
  method is proposed to guide the selection of heterogeneous features, so as to account
  for different information facets of the reported issue. An optimization framework
  is devised to select the minimum number of informative features from each feature
  set, and switch between feature sets when deemed necessary to achieve an accurate
  classification decision. Evaluation on real-world data from SeeClickFix, a government
  2.0 platform, shows the ability of the proposed framework to classify civil issue
  reports with up to 92.6% accuracy, while using 99.82% less features than the state-of-the-art.
